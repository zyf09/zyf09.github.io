I am a Ph.D. candidate in Psychology at Tsinghua University (Ê∏ÖÂçéÂ§ßÂ≠¶ÂøÉÁêÜ‰∏éËÆ§Áü•ÁßëÂ≠¶Á≥ª), where I also earned my Master's degree in Psychology in 2021. Under the supervision of [Dr. Fei Wang (ÁéãÈùû)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qHG9jEAAAAAJ&hl=en), I am conducting research in the neural associations of self-processing. I also work with [Dr. Jie Sui](https://www.abdn.ac.uk/people/jie.sui) from the University of Aberdeen. I am expected to complete my Ph.D. in June 2026 and <span style="color:purple; font-weight:bold;"> am actively seeking postdoctoral or faculty positions </span>. I welcome potential collaborations and opportunities.

>> **Abstract**: Although the self has traditionally been viewed as a higher-order mental function by most theoretical frameworks, recent research advocates a fundamental self hypothesis, viewing the self as a baseline function of the brain embedded within its spontaneous activities, which dynamically regulates cognitive processing and subsequently guides behavior. Understanding this fundamental self hypothesis can reveal where self-biased behaviors emerge and to what extent brain signals at rest can predict such biased behaviors. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the association between spontaneous neural connectivity and robust self-bias in a perceptual matching task using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 348 young participants. By decoding whole-brain connectivity patterns, the support vector regression model produced the best predictions of the magnitude of self-bias in behavior, which was evaluated via a nested cross-validation procedure. The out-of-sample generalizability was further authenticated using an external dataset of older adults. The functional connectivity results demonstrated that self-biased behavior was associated with distinct connections between the default mode, cognitive control, and salience networks. Consensus network and computational lesion analyses further revealed contributing regions distributed across six networks, extending to additional nodes, such as the thalamus, whose role in self-related processing remained unclear. These results provide evidence that self-biased behavior derives from spontaneous neural connectivity, supporting the fundamental self hypothesis. Thus, we propose an integrated neural network model of this fundamental self that synthesizes previous theoretical models and portrays the brain mechanisms by which the self emerges at rest internally and regulates responses to the external environment.
