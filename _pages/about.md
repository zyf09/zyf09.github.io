I am a Ph.D. candidate in Psychology at Tsinghua University (Ê∏ÖÂçéÂ§ßÂ≠¶ÂøÉÁêÜ‰∏éËÆ§Áü•ÁßëÂ≠¶Á≥ª), where I also earned my Master's degree in Psychology in 2021. Under the supervision of [Dr. Fei Wang (ÁéãÈùû)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qHG9jEAAAAAJ&hl=en), I am conducting research in the neural associations of self-processing. I also work with [Dr. Jie Sui](https://www.abdn.ac.uk/people/jie.sui) from the University of Aberdeen. I am expected to complete my Ph.D. in June 2026 and <span style="color:purple; font-weight:bold;"> am actively seeking postdoctoral or faculty positions </span>. I welcome potential collaborations and opportunities.

Research Interests  
======
My research interests focus on utilizing various technological approaches to address significant questions in social, cultural, and cognitive psychology.

### Research Areas

- **Self**: Investigating the fundamental mechanisms of self-related processing and its role in human cognition and behavior
- **Flow**: Exploring the psychological state of flow experience and its implications for optimal performance and well-being

### Methods

- **fMRI**: resting-state & task-based
- **Machine Learning**: Predicting human behavior through computational approaches
- **Natural Language Processing**: Leveraging text analysis to understand psychological phenomena in natural language
- **Drift Diffusion Modeling**: Implementing computational modeling to understand decision-making processes and cognitive mechanisms
