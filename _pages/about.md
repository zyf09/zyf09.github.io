I am a Ph.D. candidate in Psychology at Tsinghua University, where I also earned my Master's degree in Psychology in 2021. Under the supervision of [Dr. Fei Wang (ÁéãÈùû)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qHG9jEAAAAAJ&hl=en), I am conducting research in the neural associations of self-processing. I also work with [Dr. Jie Sui](https://www.abdn.ac.uk/people/jie.sui) from the University of Aberdeen. I am expected to complete my Ph.D. in June 2026 and <span style="color:purple; font-weight:bold;"> am actively seeking postdoctoral or faculty positions </span>. I welcome potential collaborations and opportunities.
