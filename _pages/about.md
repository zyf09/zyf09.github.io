I am a Ph.D. candidate in Psychology at Tsinghua University (Ê∏ÖÂçéÂ§ßÂ≠¶ÂøÉÁêÜ‰∏éËÆ§Áü•ÁßëÂ≠¶Á≥ª), where I also earned my Master's degree in Psychology in 2021. Under the supervision of [Dr. Fei Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qHG9jEAAAAAJ&hl=en) (ÁéãÈùû), I am conducting research in the neural associations of self-processing. I also work with [Dr. Jie Sui](https://www.abdn.ac.uk/people/jie.sui) from the University of Aberdeen. I am expected to complete my Ph.D. in June 2026 and <span style="color:#FF8C00; font-weight:bold;"> am actively seeking postdoctoral or faculty positions </span>.  
I welcome potential collaborations and opportunities.

# Research Interests  
My research interests focus on utilizing various technological approaches to address significant questions in social, cultural, and cognitive psychology.

### Research Areas

- **Self**: Investigating the mechanisms of self-related processing and its role in human cognition
- **Flow**: Exploring the psychological state of flow experience and its applications

### Technologies

- **Neuroimaging**: resting-state fMRI, task-based fMRI, and DTI
- **Machine Learning**: Predicting human behavior through computational approaches
- **Natural Language Processing**: Leveraging text analysis to understand psychological phenomena in natural language
- **Drift Diffusion Modeling**: Implementing computational modeling to understand decision-making processes and cognitive mechanisms
